# Delhi Air Pollution Dashboard

## About the Project
This project is a Power BI dashboard analyzing Delhi's air pollution based on daily Air Quality Index (AQI) data from 2021 to 2024, including key pollutants contributing to air quality. Inspired by a compelling dataset, the dashboard was created to visualize trends, highlight key insights, and propose actionable solutions in a simple, professional, and insightful manner.

## Key Features
- **Air Pollution Dashboard**: Tracks AQI trends over time, including average, peak, and seasonal variations.
- **Pollutant Breakdown**: Details the contribution of pollutants, with a focus on PM10 as the dominant factor.
- **Pollution on Holidays Analysis**: Compares AQI distribution between holidays and workdays, revealing the impact of human activity on air quality.

## Key Findings
- PM10 dominates AQI at 54.1%, primarily from dust, vehicles, and industry.
- Average AQI is 202.21, with peaks reaching 500; winters are the worst, though a slight improvement is noted from 2021 to 2024.
- Holidays show only 18% poor AQI days compared to 82% on workdays, indicating cleaner air with reduced activity.
- Of 277 holidays over four years, 71 days were "Very Unhealthy" (201–300) and 54 were "Hazardous" (>300).
- Control requires tackling PM10, implementing seasonal measures, and promoting better transport and greener spaces.

## Installation
No installation is required to view the dashboard. The project is built using Power BI, and the output is shared as a PDF document containing three pages:
1. Pollution on Holidays Analysis
2. Delhi's Air Quality: A Pollutant Break Down
3. Delhi's Air Pollution Dashboard

To explore or replicate:
- Download the PDF from the linked post or repository.
- Use Power BI Desktop to open and customize with the original dataset (available upon request).

## Usage
- View the PDF to understand trends and insights.
